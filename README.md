# This project is a Python Threat Hunting program created to hunt for Threats on the LogN Pacific Azure Network

# This project will prompt users for credientials and a brief description of the suspicious behavior that is suspected to have occurred on the network.
# The program will then create an OpenAI prompt to be used to determine appropriate tables and fields to be analyzed for suspicious behavior
# The user will also be prompted to select search priorities with various selections determining speed and robustness of search within search resource limits

# ...to be continued
